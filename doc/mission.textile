h2. What righttp wants to achieve

righttp is intended to provide a simple and clean interface for HTTP requests while allowing to override almost every parameter of the request if it is neccessary.

It is not just a wrapper of net/http

Its philosophy is to get out of your way. You want to make a quick custom HTTP request? Then just do it like you think it should work.

Below you can see the various ways to make a request:

h2. Interface

bc.. HTTP.get( 'http://foobar.com' )

HTTP.get( 'http://foobar.com?foo=bar&baz=bang')

HTTP.get( 'http://foobar.com:3000?foo=bar&baz=bang')

HTTP.get( 'http://foobar.com', :params => {"foo" => "bar", :baz => "bang"} )

HTTP.get(
  'http://foobar.com',
  :params => {"foo" => "bar", :baz => "bang"}
)

HTTP.get(
  :host   => 'foobar.com',
  :path   => "/posts",
  :port   => 3000
  :params => {"foo" => "bar", :baz => "bang"},
)

HTTP.post( 'foobar.com', :params => {"foo" => "bar"} )

HTTP.post(
  'foobar.com',
  :params => {"foo" => "bar", :attachment => File.open("path/to/file.jpg")}
)
