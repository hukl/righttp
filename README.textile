h1. righttp

righttp is a lightweigt http client library which is intended to simplify http requests.

It is in a very early stage and patches, suggestions and ideas how to improve it are highly appreciated.

h2. Usage

Currently there is only one way to perform a request:

h3. Minimal version

bc. request  = Rig::HTTP.new( :host => "ruby-lang.org" )
response = request.send

h3. More elaborate version

bc. request  = Rig::HTTP.new(
  :host   => "ruby-lang.org",
  :path   => "/en/documentation/",
  :params => {"love" => "true"}
  :method => "GET",
  :header => "x-CUSTOM-HEADER" => "Awesome"
)
response = request.send

There will be wrapper methods for the different HTTP methods in the future.
It is also possible to do multipart form POST/PUT requests with multiple
files attached.

h3. Multipart Post

bc. request = Rig::HTTP.new(
  :host   => "example.org",
  :path   => "/posts",
  :params => { "title" => "Oh Hai", "upload" => File.open("/path/to/file.jpg") }
)
response = request.send

The file will be closed once the multipart is created.

h3. Responses

When a request is send it returns a Rig::HTTPResponse which has two attributes: header and body

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
